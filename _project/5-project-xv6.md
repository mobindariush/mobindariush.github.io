description: "Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MITâ€™s operating systems course. Throughout the operating systems course at IUST, I implemented different functionalities, and system calls on top of this project. For example, a priority-based scheduler was implemented to replace the original round-robin scheduler."
