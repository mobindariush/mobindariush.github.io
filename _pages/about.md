I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student at Iran University of Science and Technology, expecting to graduate by February 2022.  
  
My research interests are:
* Algorithm Design
* Distributed Systems
* Graph Algorithms
* Online Algorithms

My favorite thing about computer science is the problem-solving aspect of it. I have tried to share this perspective with other students as a teaching assistant for various courses such as Data Structures and Algorithm Design.

My undergraduate studies allowed me to learn more about core theoretical CS topics such as discrete mathematics, algorithms, and graph theory. In the past, I have participated in many algorithmic competitions such as the ICPC, Iranian Combinatorics Olympiad, Iranian Collegiate Computer Engineering Olympiad, and more than 170 contests on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Dalisyron">Codeforces</a>.

I also like to build/hack stuff whenever possible! Nearly two years of professional agile software engineering experience has enabled me to convert abstract ideas to concrete solutions quickly. My main expertise lies in mobile and C++ development, but I have done a little bit of <a href="https://mobindariush.github.io/skills/">everything else</a>. At IUST, I further expanded my knowledge in software engineering by taking electives such as Software Testing, Object-oriented Analysis and Design, and Formal Methods.
